# Artificial-Neural-Networks-Classifier

Automated search for class identification threshold values in the case of Artificial Neural Networks
In this project we're dealing with a binary classification problem of a balanced set. We already have baseline scores having run classifiers from the sklearn suite on the dataset. What we're trying to do here is to see if we can do better than the scores resulting from the out of the box Python libraries.
The metric of interest for us is the number of false negatives. We're trying to keep that as low as possible
